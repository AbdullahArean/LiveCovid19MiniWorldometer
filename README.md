# LiveCovid19MiniWorldometer

In time of pandemic when I started learning python, I came to know many powerful feature of python.Then I thought I should make something out of my python knowledge, which might be beneficial in this context.

Information is very important for us. It makes us more concious. I thought what if I bring information more closer to us. Then I developed this project named "LiveCovid19MiniWorldometer". The main goal of this project is to give the latest information about the world as well as our country in this COVID19 pandemic situation. The starting of this program looks like:

1. World COVID-19 Status update
2. Continent wise COVID-19 Status update
3. Country wise Status COVID-19 Update
4. District wise Data of Bangladesh
5. Exit
Give input (1/2/3/4/5) to access COVID-19 status update accordingly



The main feature of this program is input refining. Suppose you gave wrong country name, it wll guess the right one. A very simple algorithm is working behind. Anyone can discover it reading and analysing the code!
